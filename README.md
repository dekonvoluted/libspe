# Background

SPE files are generated by Princeton Instruments camera software such as WinView, WinSpec, etc.
The data structure of an SPE file is published in either software's manual.
The header version used by these files is 2.5.

# Introduction

libSPE provides a convenient C++ API to access data and matadata stored in SPE files.
SPE files with header version 2.5 and earlier are supported.
LightField (another software package) uses SPE header version 3.0 and is not fully supported.

The Eigen library (http://eigen/tuxfamily.org/) is used to store the image data as a matrix/array.

# Usage

1. Build the shared library.

        mkdir build/
        cd build/
        cmake ..
        make install
        cd ../

2. Include the `spe.h` header in your source code and link to the shared library file `libspe.so`.

        g++ -lspe ...

A sample demo is included in demo/.

NOTE: libspe depends on the Eigen library (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/).
Refer to the Eigen library documentation for usage information.
