This is a simple demonstration of libspe to get you started.
We will read data and metadata from a sample SPE file and output it.

Files:

demo/
|- demo.cpp
|- CMakeLists.txt
|- image.spe

Here are the steps to compile and run the demo:

1. Build libspe according to instructions in ../

2. Create a build directory and switch into it

    mkdir build
    cd build/

3. Run cmake and make

    cmake ..
    make install

4. Go back to the demo/ directory and run demo

    cd ..
    ./demo
