This is a simple demonstration to get you started.
We'll read data from an spe file into C++ and write it back out.
Refer to the contents of the demo directory for more information.

Files:

* demo.cpp
* CMakeLists.txt
* image.spe

Here are the steps to compile and run the demo:

* Create a build directory and switch into it
mkdir build
cd build

* Run cmake and make
cmake ..
make

* Move executable back to the original directory and run it there.
mv demo ../
cd ..
./demo

You will get a demonstration of various libspe functions.
demo will also create a plaintext datafile (image.dat).
Use gnuplot or similar programs to plot it!
