SPE files are generated by Princeton Instruments camera software (WinView
and WinSpec). The format documentation is available in either manual.

The core library (spe.h/cpp) allows retrieval of metadata only.

There are two extensions available.

1. The eigen extensions allow reading in frames in the from of matrices as
supported by the Eigen library.
2. The utils extensions provide useful methods to do things like list spe
files in a directory, etc.

The extensions are independent of each other.
Your code may use both of them, either one of them, or neither of them.

Refer to documentation and sample code in doc/.
