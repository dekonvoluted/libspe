libspe provides convenient access to data and metadata stored in
SPE files. libspe supports all SPE files with header version 2.5
and earlier. libspe uses the Eigen library (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/)
retrieve and store the image data.

Follow these instructions to build libspe:

1. Create a build directory and enter it.

    mkdir build
    cd build/

2. Run cmake and make

    cmake ..
    make install

3. Return to root directory to find libspe.so

    cd ..

4. Include header files in your source code and link to library.
   A sample demo is included in demo/.

NOTE: libspe depends on the Eigen library (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/).
Refer to the Eigen library documentation for usage information.

Background:

SPE files are generated by Princeton Instruments camera software
such as WinView, WinSpec, etc. The data structure of an SPE file
is published by Princeton Instruments in either software's manual
and begins with a 4100 (0x1004) byte header followed by data.
