libspe has optional eigen extensions that depend on the
Eigen library (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/).
Refer to the Eigen library documentation for usage information.

Usage (libspe):

* Just place the spe directory anywhere in your file system.
* Start hacking!

The following is a quick example to get you started on libspe.
We'll read data from an spe file into C++ and write it back out.
Here's the contents of a sample program (main.cpp):

The above program should read in the first spe file in a directory
and average all the frames in it and write it to a plaintext file.
The plaintext dat file can be used with gnuplot to plot the image.

Here's the accompanying CMakeLists.txt file to compile it:

*******************************************************************************

This will use cmake to prepare a make file and compile your program.
Place the CMakeLists.txt file along with your main file.
Execute the following commands:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
mv main ../

This should compile your code, produce an executable and move it to
the source directory.
To run the code, simply type ./main.
